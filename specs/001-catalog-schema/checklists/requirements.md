## Notes

- Clarifications resolved on 2026-10-20: a coverage claim records full or partial coverage with an
  optional note (FR-005), and each product fact links to its own source (FR-009).
- For planning: the Infrahub Marketplace schema `infrahub/organization` provides an
  `OrganizationGeneric` that may fit the publisher entity.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
